# Alfred SF Symbols

This workflow allows you to quickly search and paste the name for [SF Symbol](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols/overview/) icons.

Previewing symbols does work, but there seem to be some [license restrictions](https://noahgilmore.com/blog/taking-down-sfsymbols/) for that, so instead of uploading the generated png images, I'll just show you how I made them: Using [this tool](https://github.com/davedelong/sfsymbols), I was able to generate image files from the SF-Symbols-Font.
```sh
sfsymbols --output symbols --format png # did the trick
```
Unfortunately [this currently only works with](https://github.com/davedelong/sfsymbols/issues/23) [Version 1](developer.apple.com/design/downloads/SF-Symbols.dmg) of SF-Symbols, so some of the new icons don't have a preview yet.
